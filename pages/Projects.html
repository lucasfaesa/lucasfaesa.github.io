			<p>"Dungeon" was the first result of my C++ studies. Initially, I started learning the language through YouTube tutorials, mainly this 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwuIEMUFUnQ&list=PLqCJpWy5FohcehaXlCIt8sVBHBFFRVWsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playlist</a>, where I worked on projects using DirectX and C++,
				while also studying in parallel on <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learncpp.com</a>.</p>

				<p>After completing this beginner's course, I wanted to test my knowledge on my own. Since I had heard about the raylib library,
					I decided to try using it. It was really challenging at the beginning, due to learning the language, the framework,
					and having little experience in low-level game development.</p>

							</video></a>
						</article>
					</div>

				<p>As I have a preference for 3D game development, I created this simple game where the goal is just to defeat all the enemies in the dungeon. 
					It took me approximately 20 days to create. But it greatly enhanced my knowledge of the language and how things work at a lower level, especially 
					in managing everything, mainly collisions. By far, this was the most difficult project I have worked on to date.</p>

			<p>“Robotim” was a project developed as part of my master's degree,
				completed in 2023. It's an educational game designed for middle school students,
				covering areas such as mathematical operations, the environment, international organizations,
				diseases, and preventive measures, among other relevant topics.</p>

			<p>Its unique feature was the simultaneous creation of a platform called the "Teacher's Area".
				In this space, educators could access and analyze students' performance data within the game,
				including scores, playtime, number of errors, and other metrics. Additionally, teachers had the
				ability to create quizzes integrated into the students' gameplay, making the educational experience more
				dynamic and interactive.</p>

			<p>Examples of data visualization for teachers include various instances, such as errors, time elapsed,
				quantity of accesses,
				completed levels, and many other statistics.</p>

				<h2>5 [Godot] Micro-Games<br />
			</header>

			<div class="row">

					<a class="image fit"><video autoplay loop defaultMuted  class="image fit thumb">
						<source src="../images/thumbs/GodotMicroGames.webm" type="video/webm">
					</video></a>
				</article>
			</div>

			<p>This project is a compilation of four micro-games I created following the book <b>"Godot 4, Game
					Development Projects"</b> by <b>Chris Bradfield</b>.
				The book uses these four games to introduce the fundamentals of Godot.
			<p>

			<p>Making these games was a very different experience. Previously, I'd only worked with Unity and C#.
				To challenge myself, I decided to use only GDScript for this project (following the book's guidance
				with some personal modifications). Godot introduced me to some interesting features, like the particular
				<code>VisibleOnScreenNotifier</code> node.
			</p>

			<p>While these games only scratch the surface of Godot's potential, I did encounter some initial hurdles.
				Unlike Unity, GDScript doesn't utilize <code>private</code> or <code>public</code> declarations,
				allowing all scripts to access
				each other. This can lead to tighter coupling and make debugging trickier. Additionally, unlike Unity's,
				Godot's error messages on the console cannot be clicked to jump directly to the error line. This was and
				can be frustrating during development.</p>

			<p>Despite these initial bumps, Godot offers a lot to explore. Just like Blender's rise in popularity,
				Godot has the potential to become a widely adopted game engine. I'm excited to continue following its
				community and seeing future updates.</p>

			<p>Since the book's focus wasn't web performance or visuals, exporting to HTML5 resulted in some minor
				performance and visual glitches. However, the convenience of testing in a web browser outweighs
				these drawbacks. Check them out below!

				</article>
			</div>

			<p>After diving into the world of Godot and dynamic languages, I felt a gap in my foundational computer
				science knowledge. So, I enrolled in CS50x and dove headfirst into C (a whole other story for another
				time!).
				The final project was to create a web server, website, or game using the <strong>LÖVE
					framework</strong>.</p>

			<p>This was a whole new challenge for me, having no prior experience with LÖVE or similar low-level
				frameworks.
				Concepts like physics, collision detection, and simply showing text on the screen, which I took for
				granted in
				engines like Unity or Godot, suddenly required a deeper understanding.</p>

			<p>Despite the challenges (especially those hours debugging circular reference errors and finicky collision
				issues!),
				it was a rewarding experience, especially for a first-timer. Coin Dash, inspired by my previous “5 Godot
				Micro-Games”
				project, is a testament to that! It's a simple, straightforward, and repetitive game, but the feeling of
				finishing something
				from scratch is truly <b>satisfying</b>.</p>

			<p>Since LÖVE doesn't have a built-in web exporter, I used a convenient web <a
					href="https://schellingb.github.io/LoveWebBuilder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversion tool</a>
				to make my project playable online. It was a bit picky about fonts, so I had to switch to one of their
				supported fonts. There's also a
				slight stutter when coins appear, but a minor inconvenience for the benefit of web play! Better than
				nothing, right?</p>

			<p>“Third Bridge” was created as a challenge/learning experience; I wanted to delve into shaders and a bit
				of modeling.
				However, in this game, I only modeled the bridge and its lamp posts; the rest consisted of assets easily
				found on
				Sketchfab. The shaders I used included effects of droplets falling to the ground and droplets sliding
				along the
				mesh of objects, as well as a water shader.</p>

				<p>Endless (Music) Racer was a personal project aimed at gaining more insight into procedural
