					I'm currently working at <b>Nurture</b>, where I've been contributing to the development of the Nurture app, an interactive experience that
					helps children aged 4 to 7 build resilience, problem-solving, and real-world skills through play. 
				</p> 

				<p>
					As the game nears its open beta phase, my main responsibilities include gameplay and systems programming. I implement new levels and game modes, 
					prototype mechanics, and translate design concepts into engaging, accessible gameplay.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Working closely with designers and artists, I also help maintain code quality, optimize performance, and contribute to the overall game architecture. 
					Being part of a small team has allowed me to have a hands-on role in shaping both the technical and creative aspects of the project.
				</p>
				
				<p> I continue to contribute to the ongoing development of <b>Nurture</b>, supporting its evolution and growth. </p>

				<p> I worked as a Unity Programmer at <b>Blue Gravity Studios</b>, where I have contributed to several key projects. One of the major projects 
					I worked on was <b>Albert's Ark</b>, a game I joined during its later stages of development. My role focused on bug fixing, updating 
					art assets, and adding new features. Additionally, I played a significant role in refining the game's UI and backend systems to ensure 
					they aligned with updated design requirements. </p> 

				<p>
					Following this, I joined the <b>Draft Fever Bowl</b> team, where my primary responsibilities revolved around UI development, 
					implementation of a new player progression system, backend communications, player/team customization, and procedural character generation. 
					Although a progression system already existed, the evolving design required a complete overhaul to align with updated game design documents. 
					I joined the project as the team was preparing to integrate the backend, which involved collaborating closely with the backend team to 
					implement necessary API communications. I also contributed to backend design, focusing on behaviors critical for seamless frontend integration.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					My general work included restructuring player stats, refining progression mechanics, fully implementing team and character customization systems, 
					creating a procedural generation system based on character ethnicity, and ensuring seamless integration with other game systems and the backend. 
					Additionally, I revamped UI visuals to align with the updated art direction and played a key role in developing a new trading system to 
					enhance player interactions.

					I worked as a Game Programmer at <b>Inside Tecnologia</b>, a Serious Games Development Studio in Esp√≠rito
					Santo, Brazil,
					from November 2019 to June 2024. During my time there, I specialized in developing VR behaviors
					utilizing the Meta XR
					SDK and XR Interaction Toolkit, incorporating both controllers and hand tracking.
				</p>

				<p>
					I led the development of many games/applications across multiple platforms, including Mobile, Web,
					and PC. My role
					involved significant UI programming and animation, primarily using the DOTween package to achieve
					smooth and dynamic
					animations. I was responsible for programming the game flow, often employing singletons and
					Scriptable Objects as
					managers to streamline development.
				</p>

				<p>
					My experience also includes leading solo projects based on client expectations and collaborating
					effectively
					within a five-member team. I developed procedural scenarios for a Runner-type game and created
					prototypes to
					test new technologies, which subsequently evolved into larger projects.
				</p>

				<p>
					I integrated external data sources with Unity via RESTful APIs and Web Servers, enhancing the
					functionality
					and connectivity of our applications. Additionally, I developed AR applications using Vuforia and AR
					Foundation,
					and simulated real-world environments for employee training, thus eliminating the need for physical
					visits to
					hazardous locations.
				</p>

				<p>
					Furthermore, I created Windows applications using Windows Forms, contributing to a wide array of
					successful projects at Inside Tecnologia.
