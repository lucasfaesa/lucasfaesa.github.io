				<p> I am currently working at <b>Blue Gravity Studios</b>, where I have contributed to several key projects. One of the major projects 
					I worked on was <b>Albert's Ark</b>, a game I joined during its later stages of development. My role focused on bug fixing, updating 
					art assets, and adding new features. Additionally, I played a significant role in refining the game's UI and backend systems to ensure 
					they aligned with updated design requirements. </p> 

				<p> Following this, I joined the <b>Draft Fever Bowl</b> team, where my primary responsibilities have revolved around UI development 
					and the implementation of a new player progression system and backend communications. Although a progression system existed, 
					the evolving design required a complete overhaul to meet the new game design documents. I joined the project just as the team 
					was preparing to integrate the backend, so I collaborated closely with the backend team to implement the necessary API communications. 
					I also contributed to designing the backend, focusing on the behaviors required for frontend integration. </p> 
					
				<p> General work involved restructuring player stats, refining progression mechanics, and ensuring seamless integration with other game systems and the backend. 
					I also helped revamp the UI visuals to match the updated art direction and played a key role in developing a new trading system to enhance 
					player interactions. </p> 
				
				<p> I continue to contribute to the ongoing development of <b>Draft Fever Bowl</b>, supporting its evolution and growth. </p>

					I worked as a Game Programmer at <b>Inside Tecnologia</b>, a Serious Games Development Studio in Esp√≠rito
					Santo, Brazil,
					from November 2019 to June 2024. During my time there, I specialized in developing VR behaviors
					utilizing the Meta XR
					SDK and XR Interaction Toolkit, incorporating both controllers and hand tracking.
				</p>

				<p>
					I led the development of many games/applications across multiple platforms, including Mobile, Web,
					and PC. My role
					involved significant UI programming and animation, primarily using the DOTween package to achieve
					smooth and dynamic
					animations. I was responsible for programming the game flow, often employing singletons and
					Scriptable Objects as
					managers to streamline development.
				</p>

				<p>
					My experience also includes leading solo projects based on client expectations and collaborating
					effectively
					within a five-member team. I developed procedural scenarios for a Runner-type game and created
					prototypes to
					test new technologies, which subsequently evolved into larger projects.
				</p>

				<p>
					I integrated external data sources with Unity via RESTful APIs and Web Servers, enhancing the
					functionality
					and connectivity of our applications. Additionally, I developed AR applications using Vuforia and AR
					Foundation,
					and simulated real-world environments for employee training, thus eliminating the need for physical
					visits to
					hazardous locations.
				</p>

				<p>
					Furthermore, I created Windows applications using Windows Forms, contributing to a wide array of
					successful projects at Inside Tecnologia.
