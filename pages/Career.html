					I'm currently working at <b>Blue Gravity Studios</b>. One of the key projects I contributed to was <b>Albert's Ark</b>, 
					a game I joined later in its development cycle. My role 
					primarily focused on bug fixing, swapping out art assets, and adding new features. I also worked extensively 
					on the game's UI, ensuring it aligned with the updated design requirements. Unfortunately, after significant 
					progress, the project was put on indefinite hold.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following this, I joined the <b>Draft Fever Bowl</b> team, where my primary responsibilities have been centered around 
					UI development and the implementation of a new player progression system. While a progression system was 
					already in place, the game's evolving design required a complete refactoring of the old system to fit the new 
					game design documents. This involved restructuring player stats, refining progression mechanics, and ensuring 
					seamless integration with other game systems. I also revamped the UI visuals to match the updated art direction 
					and worked on developing a new trading system to enhance player interactions.
				</p>
				<p>
					At present, I continue to work on Draft Fever Bowl, contributing to its ongoing development.

					I worked as a Game Programmer at <b>Inside Tecnologia</b>, a Serious Games Development Studio in Esp√≠rito
					Santo, Brazil,
					from November 2019 to June 2024. During my time there, I specialized in developing VR behaviors
					utilizing the Meta XR
					SDK and XR Interaction Toolkit, incorporating both controllers and hand tracking.
				</p>

				<p>
					I led the development of many games/applications across multiple platforms, including Mobile, Web,
					and PC. My role
					involved significant UI programming and animation, primarily using the DOTween package to achieve
					smooth and dynamic
					animations. I was responsible for programming the game flow, often employing singletons and
					Scriptable Objects as
					managers to streamline development.
				</p>

				<p>
					My experience also includes leading solo projects based on client expectations and collaborating
					effectively
					within a five-member team. I developed procedural scenarios for a Runner-type game and created
					prototypes to
					test new technologies, which subsequently evolved into larger projects.
				</p>

				<p>
					I integrated external data sources with Unity via RESTful APIs and Web Servers, enhancing the
					functionality
					and connectivity of our applications. Additionally, I developed AR applications using Vuforia and AR
					Foundation,
					and simulated real-world environments for employee training, thus eliminating the need for physical
					visits to
					hazardous locations.
				</p>

				<p>
					Furthermore, I created Windows applications using Windows Forms, contributing to a wide array of
					successful projects at Inside Tecnologia.
